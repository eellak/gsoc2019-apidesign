# :rocket: GSoC 2019 Project - API Design Tool

Welcome to the home repository of "API Design Tool".

This project is implemented as a Google Summer of Code 2019 Project, under the auspices of Open Technologies Aliance - GFOSS and National Bank of Greece.

## About the project

In the new world of “API Design First Approach” there is a need for a tool that can be used from both business or developer people to design the APIs. There are tools/IDE in the market at the moment that claim to fit this need but none has all the features required for the job.
